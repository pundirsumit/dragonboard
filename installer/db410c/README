These instructions will help you in flashing the prebuilt bootloader
and AOSP images(built from sources) on db410c.

To flash the bootloader or AOSP images, first boot into fastboot mode.
Connect a USB Micro-B cable to the OTG port and your HOST device.
Now boot into fastboot mode by pressing and holding S4 button on
db410c while switching "ON" the power and wait for following message

“fastboot: processing commands”

on the serial console on startup. Run the flash-all-aosp.sh script on
your Host device to flash boot and AOSP files using fastboot. It
assumes that you have already build db410c AOSP images locally, or are
flashing factory images.

$ ./flash-all-aosp.sh
